## Description
  This application is a progressive web application (PWA). The app works both online and offline. It is also installable as a native app on any platfrom be it android, ios or desktop. For this to happen the app uses PWA technologies such as service-workers, manifest.json and index DB from a browser. If the user uses older brower that doesn't support PWA technologies, the app still works as a regulat web app.  With this app, a user can enter transactions (both deposit and expenses) with or without good internet connection. That capability makes it perform like a native app. The app displays all transactions in a table as well as in gragh.
